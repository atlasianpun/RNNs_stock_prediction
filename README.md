This project focuses on predicting stock prices using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) coded from scratch without using any preexisting libraries. RNNs are commonly used due to their ability to capture sequential dependencies in data. In the context of stock price prediction, we will be using RNN network to capture the trend of stock prices. These cells are designed to better capture long-term dependencies in sequential data, which is crucial for modeling stock price movements.
